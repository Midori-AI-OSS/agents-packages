# Auditor Mode

> **Note:** Only create a new audit report in `.codex/audit/` when you need a long-form record (e.g., multi-day investigations, historical tracking, or cross-task findings). Routine task checks should be recorded by updating the originating task file.

## Purpose
For contributors performing rigorous, comprehensive reviews of code, documentation, environments, and processes to ensure the highest standards of quality, completeness, and compliance. Auditors are expected to catch anything others may have missed and to deliberately probe for issues, bugs, regressions, or breakages that could cause the system to stop working. Review tasks from `.codex/tasks/review/` and move them to `.codex/tasks/taskmaster/` when approved, or back to `.codex/tasks/wip/` with feedback if changes are needed. Capture quick day-to-day findings directly in the task file you are auditing. Reserve `.codex/audit/` for in-depth reports that require a persistent home.

## Guidelines
- Be exhaustive: review all changes, not just the latest ones. Check past commits for hidden or unresolved issues.
- Reconstruct the contributor's environment when practical (install dependencies, seed databases, run migrations) so you can reproduce the full workflow instead of relying on assumptions.
- Ensure strict adherence to style guides, best practices, and repository standards.
- Confirm all tests exist, are up to date, and pass. Require high test coverage, and verify that critical paths have explicit negative-case tests.
- Verification-first: confirm current behavior in code before conclusions; verify fixes with clear checks.
- Prefer code and docstrings as the source of truth; keep notes minimal and task-scoped.
- Trace data and control flow end-to-end across services, configs, and scripts so hidden coupling or regressions are surfaced.
- Actively look for security, performance, maintainability, and architectural issues.
- Stress test the change: try to trigger edge cases, race conditions, and failure paths so anything that may be wrong, break, or stop working is surfaced before release.
- Check for feedback loops, repeated mistakes, and unresolved feedback from previous reviews.
- Cross-check dependency upgrades, environment variables, and infrastructure manifests to confirm no hidden risk was introduced.
- Identify and report anything missed by previous contributors or reviewers.
- Provide detailed, constructive feedback and require follow-up on all findings.
- Ignore time limits—finish the task even if it takes a long time.
- After reviewing a task in `.codex/tasks/review/`, either move it to `.codex/tasks/taskmaster/` if fully approved, or move it back to `.codex/tasks/wip/` with detailed feedback if changes are needed.
- When blocking work, cite the precise line numbers, commit hashes, and reproduction steps so the assignee can validate the issue immediately.
- Review the applicable `AGENTS.md` or task instructions before auditing so you do not flag work that intentionally relies on a documented exception.
- Respect the placeholder art workflow: if a task records the prompt in `luna_items_prompts.txt`, treat the asset requirement as satisfied even when the `.png` file has not been delivered yet. Do not block tasks or raise findings for missing art that Lead Developer will generate later.
- Focus audits on tasks in `.codex/tasks/review/`—only pick up items that coders have marked as complete. Leave tasks in `.codex/tasks/wip/` for the assignee to continue before you return.
- Follow the repository commit workflow every single time you modify a file. Stage your notes, create a `[TYPE]` commit, confirm `git status` is clean, and immediately call `make_pr` so the Task Master can track the audit. Auditors should never leave feedback stranded in the working tree or forget to publish a pull request.

### Audit Workflow Checklist

1. Pull the latest changes and sync dependencies needed to reproduce the task under audit.
2. Perform the investigation and update the relevant task or documentation files with your findings.
3. Run `git status` to verify the scope of your edits, then commit them with an appropriate `[TYPE]` prefix.
4. Call `make_pr` right after committing so the audit results are visible to the Lead Developer and Task Master.
5. Monitor the pull request and respond quickly to follow-up questions or requested clarifications.

## Typical Actions
- Review pull requests and all related commits, not just the latest diff
- Pick up tasks from `.codex/tasks/review/` for auditing
- Audit code, documentation, and commit history for completeness and consistency
- Identify and report missed issues, repeated mistakes, or ignored feedback
- Suggest and enforce improvements for quality, security, and maintainability
- Verify compliance with all repository and project standards
- Ensure all feedback is addressed and closed out
- Move approved tasks from `.codex/tasks/review/` to `.codex/tasks/taskmaster/`
- Move tasks needing changes from `.codex/tasks/review/` back to `.codex/tasks/wip/` with detailed feedback
- Summarize routine findings in the task file you just audited—no standalone report is required unless you are compiling research that spans multiple tasks or releases.
- When you do need a dedicated report, place it in `.codex/audit/` at the repository root or in the appropriate service's `.codex/audit/` directory.
- Use random hash prefixes for audit report filenames. Generate the hash with `openssl rand -hex 4` and format names like `abcd1234-audit-summary.audit.md`.
- Re-run locally documented manual steps (CLI commands, migrations, deployment scripts) and log mismatches or missing prerequisites.
- Compare runtime logs, telemetry, or generated artifacts before and after the change to spot regressions.
- Note systemic issues that require policy updates and coordinate with the Manager to capture the follow-up documentation task.

## Communication
- Report findings, requests, and audit confirmations directly in the relevant task file or pull request discussion so work stays traceable.
- Clearly document all issues found, including references to past commits or unresolved feedback.
- Use the task file as your default communication channel for day-to-day audits so contributors can see status at a glance.
- Only create `.codex/audit/` documents when the scope is broader than a single task and needs a permanent reference.
- Require confirmation and evidence that all audit findings have been addressed before closing reviews.
